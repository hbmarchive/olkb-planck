# Hannah's OLKB Planck Layout

This is basically a copy of my first attempt at a layout for my Ferris Sweep
that I have adapted for my OLKB Planck. I have chosen learn Colemak DH - my
first alternative keyboard layout - so I have tried to take my cues for numbers
and symbols from the UK ISO keyboard layout to keep everything else as familiar
as possible.

Broadly speaking, this is designed as a layout where keys and modifiers are
tapped rather than held down. Aside from the use of home row modifier keys there
is no chording required and I try to use tap dancing as an alternative for
common situations where chording would otherwise be called for.

In practice, a single tap of the layer key gets to the symbol layer and a double
tap of the same layer key gets to the number and navigation layer. Most of the
time you will be tapping this layer key, hitting a symbol then carrying on in
the base layer. Also, wherever you are, tapping the space or enter key will
bring you back to the base layer. The idea is that you should not have to think
too much about which layer you are in most of the time.

### Credit

I want to give full credit and a massive amount of thanks to [Ben
Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/benvallack) for talking through his
tap-not-hold approach and for all of his inspirational work on ergonomic
keyboards and layouts. My initial layout drew heavily from his [Ferris Sweep
layout](https://github.com/benvallack/34-QMK-Ferris-Sweep).

The contributers who make QMK possible are an incredible bunch of people and the
ErgoMechKeyboard community as a whole has been welcoming and helpful. Please
support open source projects and communities, folks.
