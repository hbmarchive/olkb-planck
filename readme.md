# Hannah's OLKB Planck Layout

This OLKB Planck layout is a modification of the 34-key layout I use on my
Ferris Sweep. It treats the Planck as a 34-key keyboard and uses the additional
keys for extras.

Broadly speaking, the layout is designed so that keys and modifiers are tapped
rather than held down. Aside from the use of home row modifier keys there is no
chording required. The additional modifier keys on this Planck version are
mapped as one shot modifiers.

A single tap of the layer key gets to the symbol layer and a double tap of the
same layer key gets to the navigation layer. Most of the time you will be
tapping this layer key, hitting a symbol then carrying on in the base layer.
Also, wherever you are, tapping the space or enter key will bring you back to
the base layer. The idea is that you should not have to think too much about
which layer you are in most of the time.

There are additional layer keys available to access function keys and shortcuts
although, in the case of the shortcuts, they may be honed to my individual
workflow and rely on AutoHotkey bindings.

### Credit

I want to give full credit and a massive amount of thanks to [Ben
Vallack](https://www.youtube.com/benvallack) for talking through his
tap-not-hold approach and for all of his inspirational work on ergonomic
keyboards and layouts. My initial layout drew heavily from his [Ferris Sweep
layout](https://github.com/benvallack/34-QMK-Ferris-Sweep).

The contributers who make QMK possible are an incredible bunch of people and the
ErgoMechKeyboard community as a whole has been welcoming and helpful. Please
support open source projects and communities, folks.
